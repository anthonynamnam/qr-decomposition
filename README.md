## Instruction

- Matrix.py contains the Matrix Class and functions of QR Decomposition.

- All functions below in Matrix.py return Q & R matrix in a tuple.

  - QR_GS() for QR Decomposition by Classical Gram-Schmidt Process
  - QR_MGS() for QR Decomposition by Modified Gram-Schmidt Process
  - QR_Householder() for QR Decomposition by Householder Transformation
  - QR_Givens_Rotation() for QR Decomposition by Givens Rotation

- Examples can be run in main.py:

  - example.cgs() --> Example of QR decomposition by Classical Gram-Schmidt Process
  - example.mgs() --> Example of QR decomposition by Modified Gram-Schmidt Process
  - example.householder() --> Example of QR decomposition by Householder Transformation
  - example.givens_rotation() --> Example of QR decomposition by Givens Rotation

  - example.least_squares_problem() --> Example of Solving Least Square Problem by QR decomposition

- Run main.py to output the QR Decomposition examples.
